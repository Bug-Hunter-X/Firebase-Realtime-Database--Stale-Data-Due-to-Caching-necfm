The solution involves disabling caching or implementing mechanisms to ensure data is always fetched from the server.  Using Firebase's `once()` method for initial data fetching and then setting up a listener with data synchronization ensures you receive updates immediately. Additionally, manually clearing the cache using `off()` when data is known to be stale is also beneficial. For optimal data management, a proper state management solution such as Redux or Vuex is recommended to manage the data and ensure consistency.
