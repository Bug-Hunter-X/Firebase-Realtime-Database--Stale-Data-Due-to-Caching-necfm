The issue stems from an unusual interaction between Firebase's Realtime Database and client-side caching.  When a client makes a request for data, Firebase's client SDK often caches the results.  Subsequent reads, even if the data has been updated on the server, might return the cached, outdated data. This is particularly problematic when dealing with frequent updates, resulting in stale data being displayed or used in calculations. The problem is exacerbated when multiple clients are involved, each potentially holding different cached versions of the same data.
